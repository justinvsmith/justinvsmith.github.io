    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> Since I was young, I've always had a passion about developing. I starting dabbling in HTML and CSS when I was about 13 years old.
      Now all this time later, it is still something that gets me excited to jump into every day. I have recently begun a journey into learning about 
      full stack development and I am excited about the possibilities that adding this knowledge opens up for me.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> I will showcase more of my projects on this page as I build out my portfolio and gain exposure to new technologies and techniques to bring
      web applications to life and build things that people will use and love.
