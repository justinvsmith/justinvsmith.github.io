#1 What is the difference between the python shell and a python file?
#Python shell lets you run the code, but once you close it all the code written there is lost
#python files can be re-ran as many times as you want. 

#2 How do you make a comment in python?
# to make a comment you use a pound sign.

#3 How to declare a variable?
#  varName = whatever you want to store (unlike JS - var varName = whatever you want to store;)

#4 Show text on the console.
#  to show text on console, you print it. print("hello world!")

#5 How to format for loop with numbers in python
# for i in range(0,10,1):
# (you can set 3 parameters. The first is the starting value, the second is the end value,
# the last is how you want to increment[can be positive or negative])
# The end level has to be bigger than what you want the actual end to be 
# it doesn't allow for less than-or-equal to

#6 For in loop: ex= for(var = y in someArray)
# for y in someArray:
    #   print(y)

#someObj = {
# 'name': 'Cody',
# 'age': 29,
# 'location': 'Seattle'}

#to get keys and values from object:
#for ANYVARIABLE, ANYOTHERVARIABLE in someObj.items():

#another way
#for y in someObj:
    #  print(y)
    #  print(someObj[y])


# 7. conditional statements
#for javascript
#if(x ==2){}
# else if(x ==3){}
#else{}

#for python
# if x == 2:
#     print(x)
# elif x == 3:
#     print(x)
# else:
#     print(no)

# INDENTATION IS EXCLUSIVELY HOW WE TELL THE PROGRAM WHAT LINES OF CODE BELONG WITHIN A LOOP OR A CONDITIONAL STATMENT 
#There are no curly brackets or semi-colons (curly brackets for objects only.)

#8. Declaring a function 
#in JavaScript:
    #function nameOfFunction(param1, param2){
    # whatever the function will do.
    # };

#in Python:
# def nameOfFunction(param1,param2):
    # whatever the function will do.

#9. Get the length of something
# in JS 
# var x = "elephant toes"
# x.length;

#in Python:
#x = "elephant toes"
#len(x)

# 10. Add item to array/list, remove item
# var x = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
#in JS:
    #x.push(num);
    #x.pop()

#in Python
#x.append(num) -Add to end
#x.pop() - remove from end
#in python, you can remove a specific index
    #x.pop(3) will remove 4 from the array x[3] = 4

# python has an insert function that will allow you to add a number and specify it's location in the list
#x.insert(3,4). This is index you want it at, followed by the thing you want to insert.
