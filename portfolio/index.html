                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Since I was young, I've always had a passion about developing. I starting dabbling in HTML and CSS when
                    I was about 13 years old. Now all this time later, it is still something that gets me excited to jump 
                    into every day. I have recently begun a journey into learning about full stack development and I am 
                    excited about the possibilities that adding this knowledge opens up for me.</p>

                <p>I will showcase more of my projects on this page as I build out my portfolio and gain exposure to new 
                    technologies and techniques to bring web applications to life and build things that people will use 
                    and love.</p>
